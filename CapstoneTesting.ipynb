District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.\\u00a0announced the new policy\\u00a0Tuesday, promising to decline to prosecute marijuana possession or smoking cases. His decision, which takes effect on Aug. 1., comes after the DA\\u2019s office spent\\u00a0six months analyzing places in the United States where marijuana has been decriminalized.\\u00a0 \\u201cThe dual mission of the Manhattan D.A.\\u2019s Office is a safer New York and a more equal justice system,\\u201d Vance said in a press release. \\u201cThe ongoing arrest and criminal prosecution of predominantly black and brown New Yorkers for smoking marijuana serves neither of these goals.\\u201d The Manhattan DA\\u2019s office is working with Mayor Bill de Blasio and the New York police commissioner to establish when exceptions to the new policy might be necessary. De Blasio hinted at the policy change\\u00a0during a conference earlier Tuesday,\\u00a0announcing that the New York Police Department would \\u201coverhaul\\u201d its policies on enforcing marijuana cases in the next 30 days. I'm announcing today that the NYPD will overhaul its marijuana enforcement policies in the next 30 days. We must end unnecessary arrests and end disparity in enforcement. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez also asserted his stance on marijuana cases Tuesday by highlighting a pilot program launched three months ago by his office. As a part of the pilot program, the Brooklyn DA\\u2019s office, according to Gonzalez, has already been declining to prosecute \\u201csome instances of smoking marijuana in public where a public nuisance was not created.\\u201d \\u201cI believe that low-level marijuana cases should be responded to with summonses rather than arrests,\\u201d Gonzalez said. \\u201cSince 2014, the Brooklyn DA\\u2019s Office has led the way in declining to prosecute marijuana possession cases, resulting in a 75 percent decline in arrests citywide and confirming that such policy does not adversely affect public safety.\\u201d Statement by Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez Regarding Handling of Marijuana Arrests: pic.twitter.com/u6a3rkqPDH Tuesday\\u2019s announcements suggest that New York \\u2015\\u00a0a state currently exploring the possibility of legalizing marijuana altogether, as other states have \\u2015\\u00a0is starting to more forcefully tackle the disproportionate rates at which black people get arrested for marijuana, even though black and white people use marijuana at almost the same rates, according to the 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. A New York Times analysis published Sunday revealed that in New York City, black people were arrested on low-level marijuana charges at eight times the rate of white people over the past three years. The rates were even worse in Manhattan, where black people were arrested on marijuana charges at 15 times the rate of white people. The Manhattan DA\\u2019s office findings echoed the Times\\u2019 research.\\u00a0 Noting the racial disparity of marijuana arrests, the Manhattan DA\\u2019s office said Tuesday\\u00a0that \\u201clarge numbers of New Yorkers become further alienated from law enforcement and removed from community participation at an enormous cost to the criminal justice system, for virtually no punitive, rehabilitative or deterrent purpose.\\u201d\",\n          \"\\u201cAvengers: Infinity War,\\u201d the culmination of a 10-year Marvel film journey,\\u00a0set the record for both domestic and global opening grosses at the box office this weekend, according to Box Office Mojo. Domestically, \\u201cInfinity War\\u201d took in $250 million, surpassing 2015\\u2032s \\u201cThe Force Awakens,\\u201d which brought in $247 million. Globally, \\u201cInfinity War\\u201d hit a whopping $630 million, smashing the previous global opening weekend record of $541.9 million held by \\u201cThe Fate Of The Furious.\\u201d The figures are not adjusted for rising ticket prices or other inflationary factors. Still, the international grosses for the opening are even more astounding because the film shattered the record without Russia or China, where it opens May 3 and May 11, respectively. When \\u201cFate Of The Furious\\u201d opened, China accounted for $185 million of its total global debut. In this third Avengers film, the heroes must stop the universe\\u2019s most dangerous being, Thanos, before he can gather the six legendary infinity stones, which would make him basically unstoppable. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has to date grossed nearly $15.5 billion around the world. This pleases Thanos.\",\n          \" It's hard to discuss the genre often referred to as \\\"outsider art\\\" without calling into question the term itself. Referencing art made not only on the periphery of the artistic institution, but on the outskirts of society and culture in the widest sense, the category generates a boundary in its very utterance, erecting a spoken wall between what's in and what's out. A recently closed group exhibition at David Zwirner Gallery in New York City, titled \\\"System and Vision,\\\" featured artists \\\"whose unique ideas developed outside the circuit of art world institutions,\\\" in the words of the gallery.  The show featured the work of 11 artists and one anonymous collective, some creating erotic drawings, others rigidly formulaic photographs; some lifelike dolls, others convoluted calendars. What ties the exhibition and its wide range of artists together, is their mutual distance from market trends and art historical traditions -- including any awareness or expectation of being a publicly viewed artist whatsoever.\\r\\n Chris Hipkiss, Forget The Sun, 2012, Mixed media on paper, 57 1/2 x 36 1/4 inches (146 x 92 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  Despite the fact that the artists on view might never have anticipated they'd be shown at a gallery, here they were, suddenly featured at one of the biggest and most powerful contemporary art spaces in the world. As ArtReview put it, the haven is \\\"the closest a commercial gallery can come to being a museum.\\\" Last year David Zwirner himself came in at No. 2 in the publication's yearly roundup of the art world's \\\"Power 100,\\\" ranking above fellow art dealer Larry Gagosian, MoMA director Glenn Lowry and Jeff Koons, among many, many others. All of which is to say, the gallery is most definitely not an \\\"outsider\\\" gallery. So where does that put \\\"System and Vision,\\\" a medley of artists suddenly placed on the same walls as art world giants like Yayoi Kusama, Richard Serra and Dan Flavin? Let's take a closer look at the substance of the show, which was organized -- into four thematic categories: eroticism, pseudo-science, science fiction and the occult -- in collaboration with Delmes & Zander, a gallery based in Germany that focuses on \\\"conceptual outsider art.\\\"\\r\\n William Crawford, Untitled, 1990s, Pencil on paper, 11 x 8 1/2 inches (28 x 21.5 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  Sex is a common subject for many artists, but the erotic terrain navigated by visionaries operates somewhat differently. This particular breed of \\\"raw erotica\\\" is a mode of intense desire that is rarely translated into physical copulation -- whether due to geographical isolation, physical or developmental disability. Such carnal impulses reach their fruition in the act of art-making itself, yielding visuals that stray from the depictions of sex we widely encounter in art, film, porn and real life. Some are naive, others aggressive or just plain bizarre, depending on the artist's exposure to sex in the flesh as opposed to on the page. One such erotically inclined artist is William Crawford, a man whose name is only known by his signature, sprawled on some of the hundreds of orgiastic drawings discovered in an abandoned house in Oakland, California. Many of the works were created on the backs of prison rosters in the 1990s, leading to the theory that Crawford created them behind bars, yearning for sexual activity. The frequent appearance of a man with an afro and mustache, thought to be Crawford himself, provides a potential visual reference for the artist. The pencil on paper drawings depict leather-clad bombshells, group sexual encounters, rape scenes and other taboo reveries, in a style that shifts from exaggerated and cartoonish to startlingly precise. Amersand Gallery describes Crawford's artistic style as \\\"more a dream than documentation, more fantasy than perversion: the mise en sc\\u00e8ne of a sexual reverie in which Crawford is king.\\\"\\r\\n Morton Bartlett, Untitled, ca. 1950, Vintage gelatin silver print, 4 x 5 1/8 inches (10 x 13 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  An even stranger take on the erotic theme manifests itself in the work of Morton Bartlett, a graphic designer who, at the age of 27, furtively began crafting incredibly lifelike dolls of boys and girls ranging in age from eight to sixteen. Between 1936 and 1960 Bartlett created 15 dolls in secret, meticulously carving and painting their bodies as well as creating their ensembles from scratch.  The dolls look as sinister as the unusual hobby sounds. \\\"They project childish innocence,\\\" Ken Johnson wrote for the Boston Globe, \\\"but in Bartlett's hands innocence becomes a kind of tease. Note the glimpses of underwear and lacy petticoats in many of the photographs. Looking at these dolls is like seeing through the eyes of a pedophile.\\\"  Although there's some level of desire pulsing through Bartlett's dolls, there is nothing explicitly aligning them with sex. In \\\"How to Look at Outsider Art,\\\" Lyle Rexer aligns the artist's mission with that of Edgar Degas, bringing his bronze ballerinas to life. For Rexer, Bartlett's standout feat is using the power of the camera to bring the lifeless dolls a sense of uncanny vitality. \\\"They take their place almost seamlessly among the vast archive of the once-but-no-longer-alive captured in photographs, and in death they gain a convincing vitality they do not have as objects.\\\"\\r\\n Type 42 (Anonymous), Star Trek, 1960s-1970s, Mixed media on Polaroid, 3 1/4 x 4 1/4 inches (8.3 x 10.8 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  Also exploring the mystifying abilities of photography is the found collection of 950 Polaroids referred to as Type 42, capturing the expressions of television, B-movie and sci-fi actresses. The dizzying black-and-white photos, taken between 1969 and 1972, capture starlet's faces like floating heads against a black backdrop, pixelated, buckled and sparkling. Details are scribbled on the borders of the images, fastidiously recording each actress' name, television program or movie title, and sometimes measurements.  \\\"The survey of the archive shows that the photographer went to great lengths to capture specific poses and moments within these televised shows and movies. The viewer can only guess the number of 'takes' that must have cycled through to get each final shot.\\\" David Zwirner Gallery notes the level of obsession not only applied to the actresses themselves, but to the archiving system of the project itself. An artist known as Prophet Royal Robertson, who was born in 1936 and later developed paranoid schizophrenia, bridges the categories of erotica and sci-fi with his violent and apocalyptic cardboard depictions. His piece \\\"THE DAY THE WORLD END\\\" (many of his drawings are titled in all-caps) seems to stem from his first vision at 14 years old, of a space ship with God as a driver. Memories of his ex-wife\\u2019s unfaithfulness later started to fuse with his with schizophrenic hallucinations, until the impending threat of global female conspiracy seemed inevitable. His works combine futuristic prophecies with violent, misogynist fantasies, all pointing back to his own sense of powerlessness.\\r\\n Prophet Royal Robertson, THE DAY THE WORLD END, 1990s, Ink, marker, and enamel on cardboard, 28 x 22 1/8 inches (71 x 56 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  Often, the term \\\"outsider art\\\" tells more about the artist -- and his or her life story, mental or emotional aptitude -- than the art. It's a genre normally dictated by a certain kind of story more than a singular style. However, David Zwirner Gallery's statement never once uses the term \\\"outsider art.\\\" Possibly, in part, because after showing at Zwirner, they're not quite outsiders anymore. As the show's title conveys, the artists of \\\"System and Vision\\\" overlap with their individualized, yet mutually obsessive practices, as well as their imaginative visions, each molding an entire world inside the mind. Rather than highlighting the stories of the artists on view, the organizers emphasize the primary inklings of a thematic foundation, a potential method that could unite an anonymous batch of fame-crazy Polaroids from the '60s with a bizarre trove of erotic pencil drawings from the '90s. The emphasis shifts from the story to the style.  It would be incorrect to say that because these artists showed at Zwirner they are now a part of the same league as the gallery's world famous darlings. That's, in part, why 11 of them showed at once. However, for many of the exhibited artists, some of whom remain anonymous or nearly entirely cloaked in mystery, it's a radical step toward the mainstream, perhaps an unthinkable one.  As the phrase \\\"outsider art\\\" creates a discriminatory boundary, divesting untrained artists from their rightful places in the artistic spotlight, \\\"System and Vision\\\" could be a step forward. As could the language of its press release, which refuses to use the term \\\"outsider art\\\" nor another alternative. It's unusual to see a name like William Crawford alongside Alice Neel, even if its sandwiched among 10 other names. Hopefully one day it won't be.\\r\\n Type 42 (Anonymous), Carroll Baker, 1960s-1970s, Mixed media on Polaroid, 3 1/4 x 4 1/4 inches (8.3 x 10.8 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)\\r\\n Harald Bender, Untitled, 1999-2014 (detail), Mixed media on paper in plastic files in file folder, file folder: 11 1/2 x 12 5/8 x 3 1/8 inches (29 x 32 x 8 cm), 200 pages, each: 11 7/8 x 8 1/4 inches (30 x 21 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)\\r\\n Miroslav Tich\\u00fd, Untitled, n.d., Mixed media on paper on cardboard, 9 1/2 x 10 1/8 inches (24 x 25.5 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)\\r\\n Prophet Royal Robertson, NO GOOD PROUD BASTARDS, 1995, Ink, marker, and paint on cardboard, 28 x 22 1/8 inches (71 x 56 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)\\r\\n William Crawford, Untitled, 1990s, Pencil on paper, 11 x 8 1/2 inches (28 x 21.5 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne) \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

I'm announcing today that the NYPD will overhaul its marijuana enforcement policies in the next 30 days. We must end unnecessary arrests and end disparity in enforcement. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez also asserted his stance on marijuana cases Tuesday by highlighting a pilot program launched three months ago by his office. As a part of the pilot program, the Brooklyn DA\\u2019s office, according to Gonzalez, has already been declining to prosecute \\u201csome instances of smoking marijuana in public where a public nuisance was not created.\\u201d \\u201cI believe that low-level marijuana cases should be responded to with summonses rather than arrests,\\u201d Gonzalez said. \\u201cSince 2014, the Brooklyn DA\\u2019s Office has led the way in declining to prosecute marijuana possession cases, resulting in a 75 percent decline in arrests citywide and confirming that such policy does not adversely affect public safety.\\u201d Statement by Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez Regarding Handling of Marijuana Arrests: pic.twitter.com/u6a3rkqPDH Tuesday\\u2019s announcements suggest that New York \\u2015\\u00a0a state currently exploring the possibility of legalizing marijuana altogether, as other states have \\u2015\\u00a0is starting to more forcefully tackle the disproportionate rates at which black people get arrested for marijuana, even though black and white people use marijuana at almost the same rates, according to the 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. A New York Times analysis published Sunday revealed that in New York City, black people were arrested on low-level marijuana charges at eight times the rate of white people over the past three years. The rates were even worse in Manhattan, where black people were arrested on marijuana charges at 15 times the rate of white people. The Manhattan DA\\u2019s office findings echoed the Times\\u2019 research.\\u00a0 Noting the racial disparity of marijuana arrests, the Manhattan DA\\u2019s office said Tuesday\\u00a0that \\u201clarge numbers of New Yorkers become further alienated from law enforcement and removed from community participation at an enormous cost to the criminal justice system, for virtually no punitive, rehabilitative or deterrent purpose.\\u201d\",\n          \"\\u201cAvengers: Infinity War,\\u201d the culmination of a 10-year Marvel film journey,\\u00a0set the record for both domestic and global opening grosses at the box office this weekend, according to Box Office Mojo. Domestically, \\u201cInfinity War\\u201d took in $250 million, surpassing 2015\\u2032s \\u201cThe Force Awakens,\\u201d which brought in $247 million. Globally, \\u201cInfinity War\\u201d hit a whopping $630 million, smashing the previous global opening weekend record of $541.9 million held by \\u201cThe Fate Of The Furious.\\u201d The figures are not adjusted for rising ticket prices or other inflationary factors. Still, the international grosses for the opening are even more astounding because the film shattered the record without Russia or China, where it opens May 3 and May 11, respectively. When \\u201cFate Of The Furious\\u201d opened, China accounted for $185 million of its total global debut. In this third Avengers film, the heroes must stop the universe\\u2019s most dangerous being, Thanos, before he can gather the six legendary infinity stones, which would make him basically unstoppable.

This pleases Thanos.\",\n          \" It's hard to discuss the genre often referred to as \\\"outsider art\\\" without calling into question the term itself. Referencing art made not only on the periphery of the artistic institution, but on the outskirts of society and culture in the widest sense, the category generates a boundary in its very utterance, erecting a spoken wall between what's in and what's out. A recently closed group exhibition at David Zwirner Gallery in New York City, titled \\\"System and Vision,\\\" featured artists \\\"whose unique ideas developed outside the circuit of art world institutions,\\\" in the words of the gallery.  The show featured the work of 11 artists and one anonymous collective, some creating erotic drawings, others rigidly formulaic photographs; some lifelike dolls, others convoluted calendars. What ties the exhibition and its wide range of artists together, is their mutual distance from market trends and art historical traditions -- including any awareness or expectation of being a publicly viewed artist whatsoever.\\r\\n Chris Hipkiss, Forget The Sun, 2012, Mixed media on paper, 57 1/2 x 36 1/4 inches (146 x 92 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  Despite the fact that the artists on view might never have anticipated they'd be shown at a gallery, here they were, suddenly featured at one of the biggest and most powerful contemporary art spaces in the world. As ArtReview put it, the haven is \\\"the closest a commercial gallery can come to being a museum.\\\" Last year David Zwirner himself came in at No. 2 in the publication's yearly roundup of the art world's \\\"Power 100,\\\" ranking above fellow art dealer Larry Gagosian, MoMA director Glenn Lowry and Jeff Koons, among many, many others. All of which is to say, the gallery is most definitely not an \\\"outsider\\\" gallery. So where does that put \\\"System and Vision,\\\" a medley of artists suddenly placed on the same walls as art world giants like Yayoi Kusama, Richard Serra and Dan Flavin? Let's take a closer look at the substance of the show, which was organized -- into four thematic categories: eroticism, pseudo-science, science fiction and the occult -- in collaboration with Delmes & Zander, a gallery based in Germany that focuses on \\\"conceptual outsider art.\\\"\\r\\n William Crawford, Untitled, 1990s, Pencil on paper, 11 x 8 1/2 inches (28 x 21.5 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  Sex is a common subject for many artists, but the erotic terrain navigated by visionaries operates somewhat differently. This particular breed of \\\"raw erotica\\\" is a mode of intense desire that is rarely translated into physical copulation -- whether due to geographical isolation, physical or developmental disability. Such carnal impulses reach their fruition in the act of art-making itself, yielding visuals that stray from the depictions of sex we widely encounter in art, film, porn and real life. Some are naive, others aggressive or just plain bizarre, depending on the artist's exposure to sex in the flesh as opposed to on the page. One such erotically inclined artist is William Crawford, a man whose name is only known by his signature, sprawled on some of the hundreds of orgiastic drawings discovered in an abandoned house in Oakland, California. Many of the works were created on the backs of prison rosters in the 1990s, leading to the theory that Crawford created them behind bars, yearning for sexual activity. The frequent appearance of a man with an afro and mustache, thought to be Crawford himself, provides a potential visual reference for the artist. The pencil on paper drawings depict leather-clad bombshells, group sexual encounters, rape scenes and other taboo reveries, in a style that shifts from exaggerated and cartoonish to startlingly precise. Amersand Gallery describes Crawford's artistic style as \\\"more a dream than documentation, more fantasy than perversion: the mise en sc\\u00e8ne of a sexual reverie in which Crawford is king.\\\"\\r\\n Morton Bartlett, Untitled, ca. 1950, Vintage gelatin silver print, 4 x 5 1/8 inches (10 x 13 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  An even stranger take on the erotic theme manifests itself in the work of Morton Bartlett, a graphic designer who, at the age of 27, furtively began crafting incredibly lifelike dolls of boys and girls ranging in age from eight to sixteen. Between 1936 and 1960 Bartlett created 15 dolls in secret, meticulously carving and painting their bodies as well as creating their ensembles from scratch.  The dolls look as sinister as the unusual hobby sounds. \\\"They project childish innocence,\\\" Ken Johnson wrote for the Boston Globe, \\\"but in Bartlett's hands innocence becomes a kind of tease. Note the glimpses of underwear and lacy petticoats in many of the photographs. Looking at these dolls is like seeing through the eyes of a pedophile.\\\"  Although there's some level of desire pulsing through Bartlett's dolls, there is nothing explicitly aligning them with sex. In \\\"How to Look at Outsider Art,\\\" Lyle Rexer aligns the artist's mission with that of Edgar Degas, bringing his bronze ballerinas to life. For Rexer, Bartlett's standout feat is using the power of the camera to bring the lifeless dolls a sense of uncanny vitality. \\\"They take their place almost seamlessly among the vast archive of the once-but-no-longer-alive captured in photographs, and in death they gain a convincing vitality they do not have as objects.\\\"\\r\\n Type 42 (Anonymous), Star Trek, 1960s-1970s, Mixed media on Polaroid, 3 1/4 x 4 1/4 inches (8.3 x 10.8 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  Also exploring the mystifying abilities of photography is the found collection of 950 Polaroids referred to as Type 42, capturing the expressions of television, B-movie and sci-fi actresses. The dizzying black-and-white photos, taken between 1969 and 1972, capture starlet's faces like floating heads against a black backdrop, pixelated, buckled and sparkling. Details are scribbled on the borders of the images, fastidiously recording each actress' name, television program or movie title, and sometimes measurements.  \\\"The survey of the archive shows that the photographer went to great lengths to capture specific poses and moments within these televised shows and movies. The viewer can only guess the number of 'takes' that must have cycled through to get each final shot.\\\" David Zwirner Gallery notes the level of obsession not only applied to the actresses themselves, but to the archiving system of the project itself. An artist known as Prophet Royal Robertson, who was born in 1936 and later developed paranoid schizophrenia, bridges the categories of erotica and sci-fi with his violent and apocalyptic cardboard depictions. His piece \\\"THE DAY THE WORLD END\\\" (many of his drawings are titled in all-caps) seems to stem from his first vision at 14 years old, of a space ship with God as a driver. Memories of his ex-wife\\u2019s unfaithfulness later started to fuse with his with schizophrenic hallucinations, until the impending threat of global female conspiracy seemed inevitable. His works combine futuristic prophecies with violent, misogynist fantasies, all pointing back to his own sense of powerlessness.\\r\\n Prophet Royal Robertson, THE DAY THE WORLD END, 1990s, Ink, marker, and enamel on cardboard, 28 x 22 1/8 inches (71 x 56 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  Often, the term \\\"outsider art\\\" tells more about the artist -- and his or her life story, mental or emotional aptitude -- than the art. It's a genre normally dictated by a certain kind of story more than a singular style. However, David Zwirner Gallery's statement never once uses the term \\\"outsider art.\\\" Possibly, in part, because after showing at Zwirner, they're not quite outsiders anymore. As the show's title conveys, the artists of \\\"System and Vision\\\" overlap with their individualized, yet mutually obsessive practices, as well as their imaginative visions, each molding an entire world inside the mind. Rather than highlighting the stories of the artists on view, the organizers emphasize the primary inklings of a thematic foundation, a potential method that could unite an anonymous batch of fame-crazy Polaroids from the '60s with a bizarre trove of erotic pencil drawings from the '90s. The emphasis shifts from the story to the style.  It would be incorrect to say that because these artists showed at Zwirner they are now a part of the same league as the gallery's world famous darlings. That's, in part, why 11 of them showed at once. However, for many of the exhibited artists, some of whom remain anonymous or nearly entirely cloaked in mystery, it's a radical step toward the mainstream, perhaps an unthinkable one.  As the phrase \\\"outsider art\\\" creates a discriminatory boundary, divesting untrained artists from their rightful places in the artistic spotlight, \\\"System and Vision\\\" could be a step forward.

Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth-grader Kolya \\\"Nick\\\" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future. He discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals. The device can be put to both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy Nick. With the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates, and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class. The catch is, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like, while the pirates do. Also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator...) Who gets to Nick -- and Mielophone -- first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made kid movies like this one...\",\n          \"\\\"National Treasure\\\" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich\\u00e9 that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another \\u0096 attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.<br /><br />The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble \\u0096 if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?\\u0085your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah \\u0096 brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut \\u0096 at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, \\\"is that the Hope Diamond?\\\" The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct? In the final analysis, \\\"National Treasure\\\" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush.<br /><br />The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick. Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer, audio commentary and deleted scenes.

            "Text: One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\n",

            "Text: Petter Mattei's \"Love in the Time of Money\" is a visually stunning film to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. <br /><br />This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler's play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.<br /><br />The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.<br /><br />The acting is good under Mr. Mattei's direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.<br /><br />We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.\n",
